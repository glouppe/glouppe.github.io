Hi there! My name is Gilles Louppe. I am a computer scientist and researcher specializing in **artificial intelligence for science**. I am currently appointed as a Professor at the [University of Liège](http://www.uliege.be/), Belgium.

My research efforts are focused on the development of **deep learning models and statistical methods for scientific applications**, with a strong emphasis on (Bayesian) **inverse problems** in the physical sciences. I am the group leader of the Science with AI Lab (SAIL) at the [Montefiore Institute](https://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/), where we work on a variety of projects across sciences, including particle physics, astronomy, and weather science. Check out the [SAIL](./sail/) group page for more information about the team and our work.
